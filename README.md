# C64InTheDark
This is Commodore basic port of In the Dark.

The original can be found here:
https://github.com/kianryan/InTheDark

This was designed for the C64 or above.  It MAY work with a fully expanded 16K Vic 20, but has not been tested.

NOTE
If you are cut/pasting into VICE, the paste buffer appears limited to 400 lines, so you will need to do it in 400 line sections!
